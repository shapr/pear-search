# pear-search
it's a local search engine to index your bookmarks and maybe RSS feeds?

- [ ] given a URL, fetch text
- [ ] given text, build an index that points to a URL
- [ ] read a bookmarks file and convert that to URLs
- [ ] run a local server that displays exciting search results

# why bookmarks?

probably should not be bookmarks?
browser extension would be better?
as long as there's some way to say "add this to my local search collection" with *one click*

# blue sky ideas

- search your local index, and your friends local indexes!
- find more friends by local index similarity!
